The running time of INSERTION-SORT is dominated by swapping adjacent elements to insert one element in an appropriate position. If the array is almost-sorted, there are not many swaps needed so the running time would be similar to the best-case of it, O(n).

On the other hand, the running time of QUICKSORT is dominated by how the array is partitioned. If the array is almost-sorted, the partitioning would be unbalanced so the running time would be similar to the worst-case of it, O(n<sup>2</sup>)
